Date: 20-05-2025

1. Created an empty github repository for employee management.
2. Cloned it locally.
3. Created an gitignore file (right now empty.) 
4. npm init -y
   For starting a node project -> this command creates a package.json file (-y ==> give yes to everything)
5. npx tsc --init   ==> initializes typescript
6. npm i express typescript
7. npm i --save-dev @types/node @types/express
8. Create a server.ts
    import express
    create express server
    add script -> "build" : "npx tsc",
    "startServer" : "npx tsc && node dist/server.js"
    create get and post methods 
    
    NOTE: 
    a. To pass variables in the url:  :id
    b. To access vars passed in url:  req.params.varName
    c. Suppose in employees/id I am expecting a number, but I gave it as employees/Sarah, then if employees/Sarah page exists, it would be redirected to that page. 
    d. when u define a class in diff file, you dont have

9. Create employee_router.ts to register endpoints.
    import Router from express
    create a employeeRouter
    create a get request similar to the one in server.ts
    export employeeRouter

    in server.ts, 
        comment out all other requests
        import employeeRouter
        register server with employeeRouter using server.use

    basically, router is used to define set of elements that should be executed when the url, in this case localhost:3000/employee . Any further url can come after it and its logic is written in the router file. so change the get and post methods from /employee to the router file

10. Creating middleware
    create loggermiddleware.ts
    import { Request, Response, NextFunction } from "express";
    add status using resp.on("finish", () => {
        
    })
    write implementation and call next function last 

    in server.ts, add server.use(loggerMiddleware) before calling server.get

11. Database connection
    create a container in docker in postgres 
    start the container
    create a db training
        npm install typeorm reflect-metadata typeorm-naming-strategies
        npm install pg
        npm install --save-dev @types/pg
    in tscofig, add these -> 
        "experimentalDecorators": true,
        "emitDecoratorMetadata": true
    import client from pg and start coding with client

12. Orm 



15. Create folder db -> add data-source.ts
    Create folder entities -> add employee.entitiy.ts
    Create folder repositories -> add employee.repository.ts
    Create folder services -> add employee.service.ts
    Create folder controllers -> add employee.controller.ts
    Create folder routes -> add employee.router.ts


16. employee.repository.ts
    the reason we are creating this file is because previously, we use orm directly in employeeRouter and do the rest of the functions there. GetRepository is called multiple times (in mine, I have done it once only, but in the production code, if we are following the prev code, we might have to call it multiple time), business logic and db access is on the same file, complex querying might complicate the business logic. 
    Thus we are creating a custom repository to have custom orm and also separate db access and business logic.
 
17. employee.service.ts
    This is where we implement the business logic using the custom orms and repositories we created.

18. employee.controller.ts
    handles incoming request and Responses
    thus all functions would have req and res as parameters
    status code needs to be correctly send

19. employee.router.ts
    create the mapping between all router, controller, services and repositories
    pass the express route instance to controller
        
    in employee.controller.ts
        accept employeeRouter instance as well in the constructor and accept the routes, http methods and the corresponding function to be called in it. idky we did it here instead in the employeeRouter
        NOTE: 
            the function defined in the controller, after using the express router instance in the constructor, should either be defined as lambda function updateEmployee = async(req, resp) => {} or in the constructor, it should be written as router.put("/:id", this.updateEmployee).bind(this)

basically employeeRouter.ts is divided into 4 layers of files with bottom to top represented as repositories --> service --> controller --> router

20. Migrations
    db/Migrations
    in data-source, add this  migrations: ["dist/db/migrations/"] //typeorm needs the build version --> the ones in dist
    run the command -> npx typeorm migration:create db/migrations/create-employee
    here, the create-employee is the change we are bringing. So name it that
    this command creates a file in the migrations folder with a timestamp 
    the file contains definitions of two functions -> 
        up (to make any changes to the db), 
        down (to undo any changes done)
    their parameter is QueryRunner (a raw sql query file)

    write a query to create employee table (we already have it in the db)
    run the command -> npx typeorm migration:run -d dist/db/data-source.js (orm needs build product)
    error -> table already exists
    so let's drop the table
    run migration again -> employee table created
    
    npx typeorm migration:revert -d dist/db/data-source.js --> reverts the migration 
    
    npx typeorm migration:generate -d dist/db/data-source.js migration-path --> generates a migration ==> a query for creating the table is automatically generated in the migration file, the entities info is received from the data-source.ts
    Now if we build and run the migration, an error comes saying that in the first migration we already created a table. Now no table exists
    then delete the migration file we created, build and run 
    
    since build and run migration is used together, write script in package.json

    suppose we want to add new column age to date
        add the colum info to employee.entities.ts
        then call generate and provide file path
        an add-age-column 
    
    now we want to keep the record of the address of the employee. Better practice is to keep it as a new entitiy
        create new entity for address in entities folder
        add the new entity in data-source (typeorm looks for entity info from data-source)
    
    extends abstract ==> the columns in the abstract is common for most entities. We are just avoiding redefining it everytime. In db, all the entities will have the columns, with the different values (Eg: id in employee is not same as id in address)

Error Handler

import {NextFunction } from 'express"
in the try block, throw error and in catch, use next(error)
httpException is a class that is created to standardize the way all errors can be returned

in the controller and services, after creating dto, we access values to be assigned to the database through the dto. the parameter types in the functions for address entity should be changed to CreateAddressDto 


DAY 9 --> 22/05/2025

1. We want to add password to the table. 
   we add the attribute to employee.entitiy and generate a migration
   run the migration
   error comes -> password val is set as shouldn't be null. But the already existing records don't have password. 
   we edit the migration to add password column, set some random (here, 'password' is password) and then set it to not be null

2. Password is visible in plaintext in the db ==> Hashing required
   npm i --save-dev @types/bcrypt
   hash the password in services and pass hashed password to repository

3. Create auth.controller.ts auth.service.ts auth.router.ts()
    authService.ts
        creating login functionality
            import employeeService inside (to get the email details)
            Hashing in encrypted, thus cannot be reversed. in login checking, we always check passwords are same after converting the password received into hash with the hashed password in the database.

    auth.router.ts
        we need everything like in employee.Router - employeeRepo, employeeService and all the auth layers. So we import required items from employee.router and add it here
    
    add getEmployeeByEmail in employee.services and repository
    call this in auth.services and the corresponding in controller.
    add authRouter in services.ts

4. Jwt token --> store user session info --> no sensitive information should be present
    npm i --save-dev @types/jsonwebtoken
    
    in utils, create jwt secret (value must be from env var) and validity
    
    create a payload dto
    
    create token when user logged in
    sign it there itself
    return the token to controller

    when post done on /auth/login, we get accessToken. If copy-pasted to the site jwt.io, we can decrypt it and see id and email. This is because jwt tokens are encoded, thus reversible. 

5. Authorization : giving access to the only those who are allowed
   auth.middleware.ts
    take token from Authorization header
    verify the token
    call next() finally so that after middleware is executed, the control passes to the next function (here, it is employeeRouter)

   we give req.user = payload. So an error comes because express cannot accept req.user as payload type
   thus we create types/express.d.ts

   we have added role in the payload. It is of the type EmployeeRole where EmployeeRole is an enum. Add the decorators in dto

6. Authorization middleware
    if role is not hr, then they can't edit the employee table  ==> adding the middleware in front of the employess is wrong because employeeRouter handles every operation. Therefore, we add it to the routes (post, put, delete) mentioned in the employee controller 

7. Testing
   tool : Jest

   npm install --save-dev jest typescript ts-jest jest-when @types/jest jest-mock-extended
   add in package.json "jest": { "transform": { "^.+\\.(t)s$": "ts-jest" }, "collectCoverageFrom": [ "<rootDir>/**/*.ts", "!**/index.ts" ] }
     "exclude": ["**/*test.ts"] in tsconfig.json
     
   Create test/services/employeeService.test.ts
   create type-safe mockups for the dependencies of employeeService and an instance of employeeService using beforeEach

│       ├── employeeActions.ts
│       ├── employeeReducer.ts
│   ├── rootReducer.ts
│   └── store.ts


1. add employee.types.ts (all the types to be used are defined in this.. by the trainer)
2. create employeeReducer 
    initial State is empty list of type EmployeeType and action is EmployeeAction
    we call switch(action.type) and handle different cases 
    for all cases (even default), the return should be of the same type as initalState or State
3. create store using this reducer
4. Add react-redux provider over the router provider. This is done so that all the children components get the redux (App has all components nested in it as children)
5. we are creating a create action from redux. 
    if there are previous values, initial values will be that.
    the return element is {
                ...state,
                employees:[...state.employees, action.payload]
            }
6. In the form, on the form , we give the dispatch function. We pass the action type and payload to the dispatch. 

api

1. create a base api in api.ts file.
     from base api, we mean to define query structure with the url where our backend server is running
     in rest of the apis, we define the url and the http method. So when the corresponding method and url is used, the defined function in the backend is executed


Front End Testing

npm install -D vitest @testing-library/react @testing-library/jest-dom @testing-library/user-event jsdom @vitejs/plugin-react

import { expect, afterEach } from 'vitest'
import { cleanup } from '@testing-library/react'
import * as matchers from '@testing-library/jest-dom/matchers'

// Extend Vitest's expect method with methods from react-testing-library
expect.extend(matchers)

// Cleanup after each test case (e.g. clearing jsdom)

Check if username is present in screen
Check if password is present in screen
Check if button of type submit is present in screen

Test 3
Should show error when username is too long

Get reference to username input
Fire on change event of input

Check if the error message is in the screen

Test 4
Should handle successful login

Get reference to username, password and button
Fire events for onchange and submit button

Check if navigation and mock function has been clicked

Test 5
Should handle login failure

Check for error message in document

Test 6
Should focus username input on mount


Test 7
Should clear error when username length is valid

NEXT js
1. npx create-next-app@latest
2. npm run dev
3. each file path is a url path. Every folder should have a file named page.tsx so that when that url is accessed, the contents of the page.tsx is rendered.
4. app/page.tsx --> main file, the one that renders when the page is loaded. this is not nested
5. app/layout.tsx --> it renders components in every page coming
    suppose we put app/dashboard/layout.tsx -> then components under the body of the layout.tsx file will be rendered in all the paths under dashboard. We can group in and group out of the layout file using route groups of next 
6. Dynamic routing is done by giving the folder name as [parameter_name]
    in the pages where dynamic routing is required, we pass a prop named params. we can use the parameters by destructuring the params 
    NOTE : the name passed should be params itself. 
           the type should be defined for params, not the prop
    eg. 
        const Details = ({params} : {params : {id : string}}) => {
        const {id} = params 
        //rest of the login }
